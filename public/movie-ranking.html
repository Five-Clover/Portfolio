 <h1>The Best Movies According to Dhanush</h1>
 <h2>My top 5 movies of all-time</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>Dhurandhar</h3>
 <p>This movie is a classic spy action thriller.
 The performances by the lead actors are outstanding, 
 and the storyline keeps you engaged from start to 
 finish.</p>

<h3>Tumbbad</h3>
<p>Original, unsettling & enveloped with a dreadful aura,
Tumbbad is a wicked blend of fantasy & folklore that
makes fab use of its rich & riveting mythology to deliver
a dark, delirious nightmare, and is all the more strengthened
by its claustrophobic set pieces, ominous camerawork & 
unrelenting score.</p>

<h3>Kantara: A Legend Chapter-1</h3>
<p>A divine mythological tale bestowed
 with a big leap to its premier film through 
 exceptional narrative.The plot of the story 
 explores the culture, myth and belief of the 
 people in the sacred land Kantara, where they 
 believe their deity rests, exposing its powerful 
 aura when the peace and harmony of the divine garden 
 is disrupted by besiegers to take control over the 
 blessed land with adverse intentions.</p>

<h3>Up</h3>
<p>This film is possibly one of the best animated 
films of all time as it tells an emotional moving 
story while being funny. As I said the emotion in 
this film is full of heart and even though I didn't 
cry it will make most people cry. The characters in 
this are perfect even if it is a small character like 
Ellie or big character like Carl everybody gets so much 
development even Charles Muntz the villain of the film is 
also given development, even more than some superhero films 
nowadays. </p>

<h3>Inside Out</h3>
<p>nside Out is the hit Disney-Pixar animated movie about emotions, 
specifically emotions living inside a person's brain in a somewhat 
human form and controlling how people react to things. </p>

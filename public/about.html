    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      My name is <strong>Dhanush Anil Kumar</strong>, a Computer Engineering graduate with an Honors specialization
      in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I have a strong foundation in software development,
      machine learning, and full-stack application design, with a passion for building efficient and impactful systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I completed my Bachelor of Engineering from Pillai HOC College of Engineering and Technology with a CGPA of 8.66.
      During my academic journey, I worked on multiple projects that strengthened my skills in problem-solving,
      data-driven development, and system optimization.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of my key projects, <strong>PredatorSense</strong>, focused on real-time wildlife detection using machine
      learning. The system achieved high detection accuracy using the SSD MobileNet architecture and was successfully
      deployed on resource-constrained hardware like Raspberry Pi, demonstrating its real-world applicability.
      This project was also published in an IEEE international conference.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have hands-on experience with technologies such as Java, Python, Spring Boot, MySQL, and modern development
      tools including Git, Google Cloud Platform, and IntelliJ. I enjoy building scalable applications and continuously
      improving my technical expertise through projects, competitions, and internships.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond academics, I am GATE qualified and have participated in coding competitions, technical clubs, and
      volunteering activities. I value teamwork, adaptability, and continuous learning, and I am motivated to
      contribute meaningfully to innovative software and technology-driven solutions.
